# Description 

OOP game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript)


# How to play

Move player with arrow keys :)


# Demo

@todo :)





# Further Improvements:

Fix:
- [x] avoid repeating code for Player and Obstacle class (inheritance)
- [ ] prevent player from going outside


Functionality:
- shooting (recommended)
- drop different things (prizes, different types of obstacles...)
- count points
- improve game over
- levels (ex. increasing speed as user moves to the next level)
- multiple lives
- allow moving the player up and down
- settings (speed of the game, distance between obstacles)

UX:
- add images (background, player, obstacles...)
- sound

Code quality:
- apply OOP inheritance 
- detach logic & DOM manipulation
